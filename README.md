--------

A repository to sync a Processing (personal) sketchbook between multiple computers and back-up them.
Initially the repo is located on the sketchbook folder, with examples, modes, libraries, templates, and tools folders but you can clone it anywhere on your computer, if you have Processing IDE installed and for specifics sketches, some libraries installed like Minim, these sketches should works. 

## Use different editor than Processing IDE 

- Use [Atom](https://atom.io/) with the [processing package](https://github.com/bleikamp/processing) to build and run sketches.

- Use [Visual Studio Code Editor](https://code.visualstudio.com/) with the [Processing Language](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Tobiah.language-pde) to build and run sketches from /.vscode/tasks.json (CMD + SHIFT + B).


Both editors require to install processing-java path from Processing UI.
